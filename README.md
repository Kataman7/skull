**Skull – Game Rules**

**Objective**: Be the first player to score 2 points. Be careful: lose all your cards, and you're eliminated!

### Setup:
Each player has a personal deck of 4 cards: 3 Flowers and 1 Skull. All cards are kept secret from other players.

---

### **Turn Structure**

#### **1. First Phase – Playing Cards**

- Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player places one card from their hand **face down** on their personal pile.
- This card can be **either a Flower or the Skull**.
- After everyone's placed one card, the round continues with each player (in order) either:
  - Placing another card **face down** on top of their pile, **or**
  - **Initiating a bet**.

---

#### **2. Second Phase – Betting**

- A player may choose to **bet on how many cards they can reveal without hitting a Skull**, starting with their own pile.
- Once a bet is placed, the next players can either:
  - **Pass**, or
  - **Raise the bet** (by declaring a higher number).
- This continues until all players except one have passed.
- The highest bidder must now **reveal** the number of cards they bet — starting **with their own cards**, then those of others.

---

### **Winning a Bet**

- If the player reveals the number of cards they bet **without revealing any Skull**, they **score 1 point**.
- If they reveal a **Skull**, they **lose one card randomly**, chosen by the player who owns the revealed Skull.
- Lost cards are removed from the game **without revealing their identity**.

---

### **Special Cases & Victory**

- A player who loses all their cards is **eliminated**.
- If a player reaches **2 points**, they **win the game** immediately.
- If a player places a bet that would require revealing **all cards on the table**, it is considered an **All-In Bet** — no other players may raise after that.

Would you like a shorter version too, maybe for a quick game reminder?
